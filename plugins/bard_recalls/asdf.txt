Incombat it will occasionally drop a smidgen of coins, and Ireally do mean miniscule.Legend:Legend holds that the mage Poejus once hired a merchantto transport a shipment of spell components across a mountainousdomain to his kingdom.  During the journey, the caravan waspurportedly set upon by a group of marauding ogres bent on alittle loot and carnage.  The merchant, not surprisingly, fledthe scene.  A few hours later, the fearful businessman returnedto ruinous wagons to discover that nearly all his supplies wearpillaged or destroyed.  Interestingly enough, the spellcomponents survived for the ogres could find no value in theestranged paraphenelia.  They survived -- but weren't unscathed.While the merchant collected the scattered components, herealized that most of them would be worthless for spellmanufacture.  Mixed with dirt and debris, they could hardly beconsidered 'pure'.  Despite this realization, he finished hisgathering and delivered the supplies to the mage.  Poejus wasfairly understanding of the mishap until the merchant demandedpayment for his delivery -- the fact that the components wereall but useless now was not his concern.  Realizing that thepact they set had indeed been fulfilled, Poejus paid themerchant in an equally distressing fashion.  The result wasthis cloak.  The mantle contains a large sum of gold, butcannot be obtained by the owner by any physical means.  Infact, the only manner by which the gold may be secured is bytaking a blow from another creature.  Poejus hinted to theMerchant that if he wished to hold the coins, he best notrun away from his next confrontation.Original file submitted by: QueseraMore: 0-44(47) : [q,b,<cr>]", 'mob': 'Random', 'unique': 'No', 'type': 'Cloak', 'special': 'Drops coins in combat'}

It is equivalent to ours in blunt, andless than ours in edged and poison (also negative electricaland no ice or acid protection).  The legend is intriguing,maybe you can find the god's final resting place.  Note thatalthough I haven't seen one, there may be a twin poorer versionof the topaz cloak perhaps even cursed, as it resembles theother precious stone cloaks in many ways.Legend:  In the northern mountains of Fantasy, a group ofdwarven miners were greedily burrowing deep into the bowels ofthe earth.  Sometime during their venture, the dwarves noticedthat the walls of their tunnel were emanating a faint, sherrylight.  A more thorough investigation yielded the presence ofminiscule crystals embedded in the harsh stone.  The assiduousdwarves devised a method of separating the luminous stonesfrom the rock.  When concentrated in a tight mass, the crystalsproduced an uncanny level of light.  It quickly became a standardamong the miners to craft apparel using the glowing stones.Interestingly enough, this 'self-illumination' pertained tointellect as well as radiation. Theorists believe a defeatedSun God was buried by his conqueror deep within the mountains.Over time, his decaying body merged with the rock -- thusforming the crystals.  If this is indeed the case, then it islikely that a high concentration of the Topazes might be foundat the exact location of the God's grave.Original file submitted by: Quesera", 'mob': 'Random (15-45k)', 'unique': 'No', 'type': 'Cloak', 'special': 'Light source, +1wis'}

During the journey, the caravan waspurportedly set upon by a group of marauding ogres bent on alittle loot and carnage.  The merchant, not surprisingly, fledthe scene.  A few hours later, the fearful businessman returnedto ruinous wagons to discover that nearly all his supplies wearpillaged or destroyed.  Interestingly enough, the spellcomponents survived for the ogres could find no value in theestranged paraphenelia.  They survived -- but weren't unscathed.While the merchant collected the scattered components, herealized that most of them would be worthless for spellmanufacture.  Mixed with dirt and debris, they could hardly beconsidered 'pure'.  Despite this realization, he finished hisgathering and delivered the supplies to the mage.  Poejus wasfairly understanding of the mishap until the merchant demandedpayment for his delivery -- the fact that the components wereall but useless now was not his concern.  Realizing that thepact they set had indeed been fulfilled, Poejus paid themerchant in an equally distressing fashion.  The result wasthis cloak.  The mantle contains a large sum of gold, butcannot be obtained by the owner by any physical means.  Infact, the only manner by which the gold may be secured is bytaking a blow from another creature.
